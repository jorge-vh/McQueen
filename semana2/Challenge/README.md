# Week 2: Mini challenge

* In this folder, the student will find the neccessary files for Mini challenge 2.
* The instruction for this challenge can be found inside the presentation *MCR2_Mini_Challenge2*


## Description
* This challenge is intended for the student to review the concepts introduced in this week.
* This challenge aims to show the students how the noise and other perturbations affect robotic platforms.

* Using the simulator developed for the Mini challenge 1, and the different tests to analyse the position uncertainty;  estimate the uncertainty distribution and plot the confidence ellipsoid  for the  Puzzlebot.




## Notes
  - The gazebo Simulator can be found in the folder "Puzzlebot_Gazebo_Simulator"

  - The step file of the "Puzzlebot_base" can be found in the folder "Puzzlebot_Step_Files".

  - Remember to make the nodes executable using the the following command inside the catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src and catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src
 folders 
```
 chmod +x signal_generator.py
 chmod +x process.py
```

## Rules
  * This is challenge not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune explain their algorithms by themselves.
  * MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the questions contains partially or totally an answer.
  * The students are welcomed to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the classed.
  * No remote control or any other form of human interaction with the simulator or ROS is allowed (except at the start when launching the files).
  * It is forbidden to use any other internet libraires with the exception of standard libraires or NumPy.
  * If in doubt about libraires please ask any teaching assistant.
  * Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used as long as the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation on the improvements.
  * All the students must be respectful towards each other and abide by the previously defined rules.
  * Manchester robotics reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
